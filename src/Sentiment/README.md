# Sentiment Analysis
- `Sentiment_T_Tests.py`: performs t-test on trends in sentiment for posts made before and after COVID to determine if there are statistically signficant differences between them. We use a significance cutoff of .05.
- `Test_Sen.py`: re-implements Maria's code for Figure 2: sentiment analysis over the course of the narrative.
